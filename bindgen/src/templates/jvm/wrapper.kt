// Common helper code.
//
// Ideally this would live in a separate .kt file where it can be unittested etc
// in isolation, and perhaps even published as a re-useable package.
//
// However, it's important that the details of how this helper code works (e.g. the
// way that different builtin types are passed across the FFI) exactly match what's
// expected by the Rust code on the other side of the interface. In practice right
// now that means coming from the exact some version of `uniffi` that was used to
// compile the Rust component. The easiest way to ensure this is to bundle the Kotlin
// helpers directly inline like we're doing here.
